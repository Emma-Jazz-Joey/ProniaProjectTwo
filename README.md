# ProniaProjectTwo
The goal of this project is to implement team-based coding on our Project 1 and add JS functionality with Firebase integration.
We added a cart counter, as well as a full in-cart checkout menu displaying which products the customer has purchased including their total price!
A few extras were added as well such as a pop-out when you click on an item for more details.

Possible future additions might include filtering searching.

Thanks for reading,
Jazz, Joey, & Emma!
