# ProniaProjectTwo
The goal of this project was to implement git-based collaboration, Firebase integration and JavaScript functionality to our Project 1.
We added a cart item counter, as well as a full in-cart checkout menu displaying which products are in the cart, including their total price!
Other features included were a quickview when an item image is clicked, as well as a notification when the product is added to the cart.
